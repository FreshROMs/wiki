Installing a custom for the first time might be daunting. But with your data backed up, it's easier to mess up and repeat than worrying if you lost your important data.

Below are some options and services you can use, either one or some of them, in order to back up your precious memories.



## Samsung Cloud

> [!TIP]
> Samsung Cloud backs up data for most apps, **but might not back up data for your desired app.** If possible, check with the app for a "backup and restore" option, use this alongside a different backup method, or use a different method of backing up your data entirely.

Using Samsung Cloud is as easy as "set up and leave it". Samsung Cloud Backups, **if your device is already signed in to a Samsung Account**, is enabled and configured by default to automatically upload messages, contacts, app data, and more.

Plus, you can restore your data directly from the setup flow when you set up Fresh for the first time, making your restore process even more seamless.

### Backing up your data using Samsung Cloud

If you are not certain whether your data is automatically backed up, you can back up your data to Samsung Cloud manually.

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Find and select the **Accounts and backup** screen.
3. Tap **Back up data** under **Samsung Cloud**.
4. Select the data you will need to be backed up and tap **Back up now**. This will take some time depending on your internet connection.
5. Once the backup has finished, confirm if the data you have selected has successfully backed up. Click "OK" to continue.
6. Your data is now backed up to Samsung Cloud.



## Samsung Smart Switch App

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Samsung Smart Switch app exports data for most apps, **but might not back up data for your desired app.** If possible, check with the app for a "backup and restore" option, use this alongside a different backup method, or use a different method of backing up your data entirely.

If you have a large-enough SD card or USB thumbdrive to (temporarily) back up your important data to, you can directly use the Samsung Smart Switch app to export your data to an external storage medium.

Plus, just like backing up using Samsung Cloud, you can restore your data directly from the setup flow when you set up Fresh for the first time.

6. Once the backup has finished, confirm if the data you have selected has successfully backed up. Click "OK" to continue.
7. Your data is now backed up to your selected external storage.



## Samsung Smart Switch PC
